## P02 - AutoComplete in Linear Time
### Sudhir Ray
### Description:
This project is about loading a singly linked list with dictionary words, then timing how it takes to look them up. Loads all of the words in the linked list. It times how long does it to load all the words into the linked list. It also looks up for words in linked list and time how long it takes. Displays the first ten words found.
